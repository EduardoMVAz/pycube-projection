# Pycube Projection
## Linear Algebra project with matrix manipulation and 3D to 2D transformations.

Developers:

* João Lucas de Moraes Barros Cadorniga [JoaoLucasMBC](https://github.com/JoaoLucasMBC)

This repository is a Linear Algebra based project to perform projections of 3D objects and images to a 2D environment.

The code contained here shows a 3D cube projected into 2D, using pygame as the engine, allowing the user to manipulate and rotate the cube in order to see the projection working.
